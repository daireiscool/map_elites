##### Backgound
I am completing a MSc in AI, and my thesis is on using MAP-Elites as an Optimiser for the Grammatical Evolution Algorithim.  
To better understand MAP-Elites (or Multi-dimensional Archive of Phenotypic Elites) I am building a Pythonic class.  
This is based on currently on @StefanoFioravanzo MAP-Elites code (url = https://github.com/StefanoFioravanzo/MAP-Elites).

Initially will be a stand alone git repositary, bt in future would like to create a package to pip install.
